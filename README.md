This is a Java-based Hotel Reservation System with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) and JDBC integration. It allows hotel staff or administrators to manage room availability, create and track reservations, handle customer details, and enforce refund policies. This project was built for academic purposes and aims to simulate a real-world hotel booking application.
